            <h2>Visit Cartagena</h2><br>
                <p>Cartagena is a a beatiful town located in Colombia. It is in the caribbean coast and known for its amazing beaches and historic old town. The colonial architecture attracts millions of visitors annualy. It is a very safe town to visit and I find it to be more affordable than similar vacation destinations.
