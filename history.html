            <h2>Cartagena de Indias</h2><br>
            <p>
                Founded in 1533, Cartagena de Indias gained fame after the mid-16th century when great fleets stopped annually to take
                on gold and other products of northern South America for convoy to Spain. The city became a centre for the Inquisition
                and a major slave market.

                In 1811 the province of Cartagena declared its independence from Spain, and years of fighting followed. After falling
                into Spanish hands from 1815 to 1821, the city was recaptured by patriot forces. In the early national period, Cartagena
                continued as Colombia’s leading port, but it was handicapped by inadequate connections with the interior. By the 1840s
                it had declined in population and commerce. In the 20th century it experienced renewed growth and is now Colombia’s
                fifth largest city. Probably the most significant factor in Cartagena’s revitalization was the opening of petroleum
                fields in the Magdalena River valley after 1917. The completion of the pipeline from Barrancabermeja to the Bahía de
                Cartagena in 1926, and the building of an oil refinery, helped make the city the country’s chief oil port; platinum and
                coffee are other important exports. Manufactures include sugar, tobacco products, cosmetics, textiles, fertilizer, and
                leather goods. Tourism is of increasing importance. Pop. (2011 est.) 911,300.
